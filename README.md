Space and time complexity analysis of Running time of alagorithms

Time Complexity
Outer Loop (for-loop) Iterates n-1 times where n is the size of the array.
Inner Loop (while-loop):Iterates i times for each iteration of the outer loop.
Taking this into account the time complexity is O(n^2)

Space Complexity
Input Size: The size of the input array is `n`.

Therefore, the space complexity is O(1) (constant space complexity)
